## Using NED
No runtime is required for this version of NED.

### General Use
Desktop NED does not support mouse input currently. The use of the ```TAB``` key (```TAB``` to go forward, ```SHIFT-TAB``` to go backwards) and ```ENTER``` key is required. 

### Precautions
- Only keys between 10 and 74 can be decrypted **without** error.
- High recursions are probably not good to use...

### Accessing The App
- Download the NED executable from the releases page
- Run the NED executable
- Have fun :D

## Planned Updates
- Password Encryption
